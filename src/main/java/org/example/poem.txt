I am blue on the gray animal farm,
But, doomed to slaughter by my color,
Behind the ungnawable wire mesh,
I find no solace in being blue.

And I molt. I rage fiercely,
Tearing myself furiously apart,
But the blue, splashing and exulting,
Penetrates through the skin, betrayingly blinding.

And I howl, shivering, faintly howl,
Like a shaggy trumpet of the Supreme Court,
Begging the stars for freedom forever,
Or at least a permanent molt.

A foreign master on a tape recorder
Recorded my howl. What a simpleton!
He didn't howl himself, though he could have
Howled too, having ended up here - not that bad.

And I fall to the floor, dying,
Yet unable to die at all.
I gaze mournfully at my native Dachau
And know - nowhere will I escape.

Once, after dining on rotten fish,
I saw that the door was not on a hook,
And I leaped into the abyss of stellar escape
With the thoughtlessness typical of a rookie.

Moon carats flew into my eyes.
Taking the moon as my guide,
I understood that the sky is not divided into squares,
As it seemed from inside the cage.

I tumbled. I sharpened pencils with trees.
I was myself. And the snow, shimmering,
Was not afraid that it too was blue.

But I grew tired. I was tossed by storms.
I couldn't free my entangled paws,
And I had neither friend nor companion.
A child of captivity is weak for freedom.

Those conceived in the cage cry for the cage,
And with horror, I realized that I love
That cage that keeps me behind bars,
And the animal farm - my homeland.

And I returned, wretched and beaten,
But only to find myself in a cage again,
Where guilt turned into resentment
And transformed into hatred as love.

There have been changes on the animal farm,
They used to suffocate us simply in bags.
Now, we are killed in a modern way,
With electricity. Clean and tidy.

I gaze at the Eskimo-animal keeper.
Her hand glides gently over me,
And her fingers gently scratch my neck,
But in her angelic eyes - there is melancholy.

She will save me from all illnesses,
And won't let me die of starvation,
But I know that within my iron term,
As is expected of her - she will betray me.

She will pierce me, shedding tears,
Inserting a wire in my mouth, whispering deceitfully...
Be humane to the workers! Introduce
The position of an executioner on the animal farm!

I would like to be naive, like my ancestors,
But I was born in captivity. I'm not the same.
Whoever feeds me - I will be loyal to them.
Whoever strokes me - they will kill me.
